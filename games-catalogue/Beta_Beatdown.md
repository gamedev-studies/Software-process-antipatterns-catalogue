# Beta Beatdown

## Summary
Players heavily criticize and give low ratings to a game that is still in Beta/Early Access

## Context
The PM from Ashes of the Singularity (2015) reports that the game was overwhelmed by low ratings on Steam while being on Early Access. When the game was released, the low scores stuck around, and they took some time to go up. This impacted marketing and pricing negatively.

## Symptoms and Consequences
- Project beta/Early Access is receiving heavy criticism in a non-constructive way from players/testers
- Project beta/Early Access is receiving low ratings, which in turn shape the way players see the game and influence their purchase decisions

## Refactored Solutions
- Communicate better to make clear the game is not in a finished state
- Continously talk to playtesters and community to keep them updated on the Beta/Early Access status and when the game will be released

## Suggested/adopted PM solutions
- "I won’t say we will never do Steam Early Access again. But I will say that I’m not inclined to use it on a game that is using a brand-new engine." (Ashes of the Singularity, 2015)
