# Beta Beatdown

## Summary
Players heavily criticize and give low ratings to a game that is still in Beta/Early Access by a lack of understanding that it is a work in progress.

## Context
The PM from [Ashes of the Singularity (2015)](https://github.com/polako/pms-prob-after-years/blob/master/data/postmortems/pdfs/gamasutra/2015/29_ashes_of_the_singularity.pdf) reports that the game was overwhelmed by low ratings on Steam while being on Early Access. When the game was released, the low scores stuck around, and they took some time to go up. This impacted marketing, sales and pricing negatively.

## Symptoms and Consequences
- Project beta/Early Access is receiving heavy criticism in a non-constructive way from players/testers
- Project beta/Early Access is receiving low ratings, which in turn shape the way players see the game and influence their purchase decisions

## Refactored Solutions
- According to [Lin et al, 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317570653_An_Empirical_Study_of_Early_Access_Games_on_the_Steam_Platform):
    - **Do not release too early as Early Access**: "(...) developers should release the game in a more content and feature-rich state."
    - **State your game's proposal**: "(...) clearly indicate in the 'original promise' which features were securely funded, and which portion of the game was dependent on early access sales"
    - **Communicate issues/fixes continuously**: "(...)  if the studio could communicate with player immediately when trouble firstly came up, the players could have helped by recommending the game to friends and relatives, or even bought copies for them."
    - **Do not rely financially on Early Access**: "It is risky to use the early access model as the main funding source".
- According to [Xsolla, 2021](https://xsolla.com/blog/early-access-will-it-help-or-hurt-your-game):
    - **React to player feedback**: "Make sure you're ready to implement feedback in order to keep interest in your game high until the official launch."
    - **Evolve as you develop**: "Make sure your game is playable and professional to garner positive attention and stand out from the rest, but don't release a finished game either." 
    - **Do not rely financially on Early Access**: "Don't rely on Early Access to fund your game, but do look at the platform as a potential avenue for additional income"

### Suggested/adopted PM solutions
- "I won't say we will never do Steam Early Access again. But I will say that I'm not inclined to use it on a game that is using a brand-new engine."
