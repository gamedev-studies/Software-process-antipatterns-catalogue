# Balancing issues

## Summary
Game designers have a hard time balancing the game's difficulty. Creating this balance demands havey testing and cause rework that often propagates to art, design and coding teams.

## Context
Difficulty is often a point of discussion on game projects. The PM from A Boy and His Blob (2010) reports that balancing boss battles was "a source of strife throughout development". The developers from Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs (2014) report that the difficulty of puzzles caused disagreements between studio (The Chinese Room) and publisher (Frictional Games). In the end, the studio has conceded to the publisher's vision and made gameplay changes that "impacted a number of scenarios in the game".

In Heavy Gear II (1999), developers and testers noticed early in the project that the game had "a distinct absence of thrilling game play". In Deadliest Warrior (1999), despite "100,000 battle simulations" and a "fulltime team of dedicated testers", a balancing problem was discovered only after the game's release: the Ninja character was overpowered. 

## Symptoms and Consequences
- People in the project frequently discuss the need of making levels and challenges harder/easier
- Testers or players frequently report that they are not satisfied with the game's challenges

## Refactored Solutions
- Get the team aligned on the same vision for the game's levels and challenges early in the project
- Continuously test the game's challenges and adapt the design according to the feedback from the target players

## Suggested/adopted PM solutions
- "We were able to create a Title Update that addressed all the balance issues. If we were not listening to the community, it would not have been possible to get this done as quickly as we did" (Deadliest Warrior, 1999)
- "Only after some ad hoc brainstorming sessions and grueling mission-by-mission playability tests did the pieces come together." (Heavy Gear II, 1999)
- "We realized too late that the methodical gameplay of Blob really doesn't support actiony bosses of this nature. (...) In future games like Blob, boss battles would be better as methodical puzzles that play to the strengths of the gameplay." (A Boy and His Blob, 2010)
- "The issues with the game's difficulty were compounded by the game's design too clearly telegraphing transitions between 'enemy' areas and 'non-enemy' areas. Analyzing the game in light of the player responses online, this is clearly one aspect of the game in which TCR failed." (Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, 2014)
