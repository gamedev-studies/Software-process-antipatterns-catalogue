# No Tool Standard

## Summary
People working in a project use different tools to do identical or similar tasks, which results in quality inconsistencies and a production process that is hard to maintain.

## Context
In Descent 3 (1999), level designers used 3 different tools for 3D modelling: 3D Studio Max, Lightwave, and a custom modeler. 

## Symptoms
- People within the same department (e.g art, animation, programming) do not follow any standard as to which tools to use
- People are unable to carry on or maintain their coworker's work due to tool incompatibility or lack of knowledge on how these tools work
- People waste to much time building their own custom toolset, which is not documented or shared

## Refactored Solutions
- Defining a standard toolset from the beginning of the project
- Prototyping with different tools to assure the project quality requirements are met by the chosen toolset, so as to avoid further changes

## Suggested/adopted PM solutions
- "What we should have done is standardized using one tool (probably 3D Studio Max) and made the designers learn how to use it whether or not they were comfortable with it. This would have allowed us to make use of certain features that 3D Studio Max has (such as parametric surfaces) without worrying about whether Lightwave or the custom modeler supported that feature." (Descent 3, 1999)
