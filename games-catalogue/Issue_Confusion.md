# Issue Confusion

## Summary
Support and testing teams are overwhelmed by issues/bugs and unable to analyse and track them properly.

## Context
In Cultist Simulator (2019), Alexis (the game's creator), reportedly received "a deluge of DMs" on his Twitter and "an unwieldy number of support tickets" due to bugs on the game detected after release, which made him " tired and worried and painfully aware of all the flaws in the game". 

In Offworld Trading Company (2016), the QA process reportedly had trouble defining which bugs were prioritary, and which were really worth taking the time to test and fix, since many of the game's systems were placeholders.

## Symptoms
- Support and testing teams are feeling overwhelmed by open tickets, not just by a matter of quantity, but also because they present issues that are hard to analyse
- There is no organized process to receive bugs from players/playtesters, neither to analyse, prioritize, fix and track these issues

## Refactored Solutions
- Defining a process for issue analysis and tracking, which includes teams and tools
- Keep open lines of communication between development and testing to help sorting out and solving issues

## Suggested/adopted PM solutions
- "My takeaway here honestly is to book in a goddamn holiday before our next launch, so Alexis doesn't get that torrent of negativity" (Cultist Simulator, 2019)
- "We'll also devote more time to closing in our next project, so thereâ€™s a higher level of polish and a lower chance of getting avoidable UI/UX tickets" (Cultist Simulator, 2019)
- "I gave each team member the right to make a judgment call on which bugs to ignore" (Offworld Trading Company, 2016)
