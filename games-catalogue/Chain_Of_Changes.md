# Chain of Changes

## Summary
Plot or gameplay changes later in the game's development demand rework for art, design and UI/UX teams.

## Context
In Star Trek: Hidden Evil (1999), the PM author states that "after removing many scenes from the game, we needed to repair the holes left in the story". In Dead Head Fred (2007), plot changes impacted "not only scriptwriting time, but animation time as well". The PM from Cultist Simulator (2019) reports that due to the perception that game mechanics were a bit obscure, the studio "spent a bunch more money and time on improvements to the UI system, so these too would lead the player subtly but constantly through the game".

## Symptoms
- The game does not have a design document, or it is not well consolidated
- The project does not have enough people to keep up with all required changes
- Little to no attention to prototyping

## Refactored Solutions
- Prototype early in the project to determine what are the strong plot/gameplay points that are likely sticking around until the end of the project
- Defining a game design document early in the project and keep it updated

## Suggested/adopted PM solutions
- "Our solution for many of these cuts was to create a prescripted cut scene. Some of them showed basic actions or events but most fell into the category of 'data dump'. These are scenes that obviously exist for no purpose other than to convey information to the player." (Star Trek: Hidden Evil, 1999)
- "We'll see if we can do better next time, and definitely wonâ€™t try to fix it just one month before we release..." (Cultist Simulator, 2019)
- "We ended up having to cut some of the mini-games that we had originally planned, to save development time. Unfortunately, the decision to do so was not made early in the development process" (Dead Head Fred, 2007)
- "There is a lot we can improve on when we start a new intellectual property -- procedures, attention to scope, nailing down the design early, and so on" (Dead Head Fred, 2007)
